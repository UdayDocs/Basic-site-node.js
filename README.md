This project is part of <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com">The Odin Project</a> curriculum, focusing on getting familiar with the basics of Node.js and server-side development. The primary goal was to understand core concepts such as routing, file handling, and creating a simple server to serve static HTML pages.
